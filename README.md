# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work

My motivation is to learn to control all the elements that make up web applications in order to design personalized applications.

I built this project to refresh previous notions and to learn new things.

The main issues I ran into was getting used to git commands and using github.

I learned how to use github from creating a repository, adding my ssh handle, syncing it with my editor, and using basic commands for development. I also learned basic git commands and how to create a professional Readme.

## Installation

## Usage

 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
